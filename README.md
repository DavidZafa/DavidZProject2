#Web Application - Fantasy Basketball Team Selector
Created by David Zafirovic

#Description
This application allows users to generate their own prospective fantasy basketball team in order to figure out how they'd like to draft/make up their team. The application allows users to make accounts and make their own teams, and add/remove players at will.

#Technologies Used
Handlebars, Node, Mongoose, Node, and Express were all used to make this project happen. They all worked in tandem to give the website views and pages, and populate them with data that users can manipulate. 

#Features
This project allows users to:
A) Make their own, unique account on the website
B) Add players to their team
C) View player info on their 'My Team' page
D) Add and remove players from their team

#Approach
I approached this project wanting to make something simple. but as most know, that is easier said than done. I wound up going back to the drawing board a few times, and ended up with this final idea, the fantasy basketball team creator. It combines my love of basketball with my love of code, and it ended up looking really good, so I am quite happy with the final product.
